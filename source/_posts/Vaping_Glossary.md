Advanced Personal Vaporizer (APV)- call up them mods, e-cig mods, these devices are larger than a pen-design vaporizer. They are often mechanical, variable voltage, or adjustable wattage.

Amps- brief for amperage, this denotes the move of energy around a good circuit. The low the resistance, the higher the amps had a need to prevent overheating.

__Atomizer__ - the standard heating element within an e-cig. As it gets hotter, it turns the e-juice into vapor.

__Box Mod__ - a kind of mod shaped such as a box

__Cartomizer__ - a combination cartridge and clearomizer. They could be refillable or disposable.

__Cartridge__ - removable container that may contain e-liquid, cannabis concentrates, or other vaporizing materials. Typically disposable, but could be refillable.

__E-Liquid/E-Juice__ - terms for the liquids that e-cigarettes use to create vapor. Also called vape juice.

__mAh__ - a great abbreviation for milliamp time, or the amount of time a electric battery will last.

__Ohm__ - a product of measurement employed to denote electrical resistance. More affordable ohms mean a hotter and thicker vapor, while bigger ohms means a cooler vape.

__RBA, RDA, RTA__ - acronyms for the following: 'Rebuildable Atomizer'. 'Rebuildable Drip Atomizer', and 'Rebuildable Tank Atomizer'. These refer to tanks and atomizers that allow users to build their own coils and wicks.

__Tank__ - A good clearomizer with a more substantial capacity, usually manufactured from glass or plastic material, that holds a larger amount of e-liquid, usually 3 to 6 mL.

__VV or Variable Voltage__ - a kind of mod which allows its user to adjust the volume of voltage up or straight down.

__VW or perhaps Variable Wattage__ - a type of mod that allows its individual to adjust how much wattage up or down.

## Common User Terms

ALL DAY LONG Vape- a term employed to make reference to a person's beloved flavor of e-liquid. It's the taste they currently enjoy enough to vape on all day.

__Kick__ - synonymous with throat hit, it's the feeling on the throat when 1 inhales the vapor. Previous smokers usually prefer an increased kick, which is manufactured with a PG heavy juice.

__PG__ - propylene glycol, among the components of e-juice. Usually found in conjunction with veggie glycerol, flavoring, and nicotine. More PG means fewer vapor, but more throat hit.

__Nicotine__ - also called 'Nic', this is a parasympathomimetic stimulant found in the nightshade category of plants. It might be addictive and is generally denoted by a share in e-juice.

__Sub-Ohming__ - the practice of blowing larger clouds by by using a coil, either purchased or built, with an ohm reading underneath 1.0 ohm.

__VG__ - veggie glycerol, another of the components of e-juice. Considerably more VG equates to more vapor, but less throat hit.

__Vaper's Tongue__ - a good term used to spell it out the loss of sensation or the desensitization experienced after a long vaping session or after employing the same taste for extended periods of time.

## Vaping Terms

3-in-1- a term used to spell it out vaporizers that may use dry herb, oils, or wax. Generally needs switching out a container or a cartridge, according to the chemical being vaped.

__Conduction__ - a kind of vaporizer where in fact the cannabis causes direct contact with the heating element.

__Dabbing__ - the practice of vaporizing a cannabis concentrate like wax or shatter and putting it on to a heated area, which in turn produces a vapor that is inhaled.
